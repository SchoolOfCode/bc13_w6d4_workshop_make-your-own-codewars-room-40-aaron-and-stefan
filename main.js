// You will be given an array of numbers. Your objective is to replace multiples of 3 with "Fizz" and multiples of 5 are replaced by "Buzz". Multiples of both 3 and 5 are replaced with "FizzBuzz".

// The Fizz and Buzz numbers will always be integers between 1 and 100, and the sequence will have a maximum length of 100. 

// Examples

// [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] ==> [1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz", "Fizz"] 


function FizzBuzzifier(array) {
    // Enter your amazing code solution here
